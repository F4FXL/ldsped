ldsped (1.16b3)

  * extra checks in the installation script. Now it always should
    construct a valid PHG probe
  * unregistering a call did send a response, which confused
    digi_ned. Removed the response (since the agwpe specs specify
    the application has not to expect one)
  * fixing the probe, position data where missing
  * APRSQ implemented

    (estabished and pending ones)
